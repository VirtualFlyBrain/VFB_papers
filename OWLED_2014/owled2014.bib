				AbstractThe stereotyped structure of mammalian and invertebrate brains is a crucial determinant of their circuit organization. Thus large scale efforts to map circuit organization using 3D image data are underway in a number of model systems, including flies and mice. Many of these studies use registration of sample images to a standard template brain to enable co-visualization and spatial querying. However, studies often use distinct template brains, resulting in large islands of data which cannot be directly compared. To enable this comparison, we have constructed bridging registrations between template brains accounting for the vast majority of Drosophila melanogaster 3D neuroanatomical data. Furthermore, we solve the related problem of mapping data between the left and right brain hemispheres via the construction of mirroring registrations. Finally, we extend our approach across species to demonstrate its potential use in evolutionary studies of neural circuit structure and provide bridging registrations that link a new set of template brains generated for four Drosophila species that are divergent over 40 million years of evolution.

We describe our strategy, document the freely available anatomical data and open source com- puter tools that we have generated and provide numerous examples of their use. This effort has unified data from over 30,000 publicly available images, with resources including the 3D atlas embodying the new standard Drosophila anatomical nomenclature and the largest single neuron databank yet available in any species. Over 20,000 registered images have been contributed to the Virtual Fly Brain project and can be viewed online at www.virtualflybrain.org.Received June 19, 2014.Accepted June 19, 2014.{\textcopyright} 2014, Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory PressThe copyright holder for this pre-print is the author.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anatomy ontologies are query-able classifications of anatomical structures. They provide a widely-used means for standardising the annotation of phenotypes and expression in both human-readable and programmatically accessible forms. They are also frequently used to group annotations in biologically meaningful ways. Accurate annotation requires clear textual definitions for terms, ideally accompanied by images. Accurate grouping and fruitful programmatic usage requires high-quality formal definitions that can be used to automate classification and check for errors. The Drosophila anatomy ontology (DAO) consists of over 8000 classes with broad coverage of Drosophila anatomy. It has been used extensively for annotation by a range of resources, but until recently it was poorly formalised and had few textual definitions.

RESULTS: We have transformed the DAO into an ontology rich in formal and textual definitions in which the majority of classifications are automated and extensive error checking ensures quality. Here we present an overview of the content of the DAO, the patterns used in its formalisation, and the various uses it has been put to.

CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the work described here, the DAO provides a high-quality, queryable reference for the wild-type anatomy of Drosophila melanogaster and a set of terms to annotate data related to that anatomy. Extensive, well referenced textual definitions make it both a reliable and useful reference and ensure accurate use in annotation. Wide use of formal axioms allows a large proportion of classification to be automated and the use of consistency checking to eliminate errors. This increased formalisation has resulted in significant improvements to the completeness and accuracy of classification. The broad use of both formal and informal definitions make further development of the ontology sustainable and scalable. The patterns of formalisation used in the DAO are likely to be useful to developers of other anatomy ontologies.},

   Abstract={High-throughput phenotyping projects in model organisms have the potential to improve our understanding of gene functions and their role in living organisms. We have developed a computational, knowledge-based approach to automatically infer gene functions from phenotypic manifestations and applied this approach to yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), nematode worm (Caenorhabditis elegans), zebrafish (Danio rerio), fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster) and mouse (Mus musculus) phenotypes. Our approach is based on the assumption that, if a mutation in a gene [Formula: see text] leads to a phenotypic abnormality in a process [Formula: see text], then [Formula: see text] must have been involved in [Formula: see text], either directly or indirectly. We systematically analyze recorded phenotypes in animal models using the formal definitions created for phenotype ontologies. We evaluate the validity of the inferred functions manually and by demonstrating a significant improvement in predicting genetic interactions and protein-protein interactions based on functional similarity. Our knowledge-based approach is generally applicable to phenotypes recorded in model organism databases, including phenotypes from large-scale, high throughput community projects whose primary mode of dissemination is direct publication on-line rather than in the literature.}

   Abstract={Ontologies are widely used in the biomedical community for annotation and integration of databases. Formal definitions can relate classes from different ontologies and thereby integrate data across different levels of granularity, domains and species. We have applied this methodology to the Ascomycete Phenotype Ontology (APO), enabling the reuse of various orthogonal ontologies and we have converted the phenotype associated data found in the SGD following our proposed patterns. We have integrated the resulting data in the cross-species phenotype network PhenomeNET, and we make both the cross-species integration of yeast phenotypes and a similarity-based comparison of yeast phenotypes across species available in the PhenomeBrowser. Furthermore, we utilize our definitions and the yeast phenotype annotations to suggest novel functional annotations of gene products in yeast.}

   Abstract={This paper describes an approach to providing computer-interpretable logical definitions for the terms of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) using PATO, the ontology of phenotypic qualities, to link terms of the HPO to the anatomic and other entities that are affected by abnormal phenotypic qualities. This approach will allow improved computerized reasoning as well as a facility to compare phenotypes between different species. The PATO mapping will also provide direct links from phenotypic abnormalities and underlying anatomic structures encoded using the Foundational Model of Anatomy, which will be a valuable resource for computational investigations of the links between anatomical components and concepts representing diseases with abnormal phenotypes and associated genes.}

   Abstract={Ontologies are becoming increasingly important for the efficient storage, retrieval and mining of biological data. The description of phenotypes using ontologies is a particularly complex problem. We outline a schema that can be used to describe phenotypes by combining orthologous axiomatic ontologies. We also describe tools for storing, browsing and searching such complex ontologies. Central to this approach is that assays (protocols for measuring phenotypic characters) describe what has been measured as well as how this was done, allowing assays to link individual organisms to ontologies describing phenotypes. We have evaluated this approach by automatically annotating data on 600,000 mutant mice phenotypes using the SHIRPA protocol. We believe this approach will enable the flexible, extensible and detailed description of phenotypes from any organism.}

   Abstract={Understanding the developmental and genetic underpinnings of particular evolutionary changes has been hindered by inadequate databases of evolutionary anatomy and by the lack of a computational approach to identify underlying candidate genes and regulators. By contrast, model organism studies have been enhanced by ontologies shared among genomic databases. Here, we suggest that evolutionary and genomics databases can be developed to exchange and use information through shared phenotype and anatomy ontologies. This would facilitate computing on evolutionary questions pertaining to the genetic basis of evolutionary change, the genetic and developmental bases of correlated characters and independent evolution, biomedical parallels to evolutionary change, and the ecological and paleontological correlates of particular types of change in genes, gene networks and developmental pathways.}
